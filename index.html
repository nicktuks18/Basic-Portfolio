                   <div class="col-sm-9">My name is Cliff Mutuku. Anyone that knows me well calls me Nick. I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. My family and I relocated to the United States of American immediately after I graduated from high school to chase what everyone calls the “American Dream”. We settled down in Orlando Florida and after relocated to Chicago, IL.
                       <p> Growing up I knew that my dream career was to either be a pilot or an IT guru. I started off by attending a local community college to seek a degree in IT and also attended St Andrews university for flight maintenance degree with the goal of becoming a pilot one day. I graduated with an associate degree in IT studies from Ivy Tech Community College. After receiving my diploma, life didn’t go as planned and had some push backs in life. I didn’t lose hope or sight, but I knew one day that I will accomplish my goal and interest. In 2017, I was able to start a logistics company which is currently running and performing very well. Operating my company has given me the opportunity to go after my goal of becoming a web developer/programmer.
